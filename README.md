# Nanopore
This program, Nanopore, is developed based on the toolbox Parallel Hierarchical Grid (PHG), whch is currently under active development at State Key Laboratory of 
Scientific and Engineering Computing of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Please refer to http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/phg/ to get more details about the installation 
and usage of PHG. Afer PHG has been successfully installed, you need to change the content of 'PHG_MAKEFILE_INC' in Makefile to the installation path of PHG on your computer. Then you can compile and run our program by running 'work.sh'.
